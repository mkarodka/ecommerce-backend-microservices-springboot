Here's your **formatted `README.md`** ready to be used on GitHub. I’ve cleaned up spacing, fixed syntax, ensured proper code blocks, and preserved image placeholders for easy replacement with actual image URLs:

# 📦 ecommerce-backend-microservices-springboot

Scalable e-commerce backend built with Spring Boot microservices, Docker, and PostgreSQL. Features API Gateway, Eureka Discovery, and service observability with Grafana.

This project is a hands-on implementation of a **microservices-based backend system** built with **Spring Boot, Docker, and PostgreSQL**. It simulates a simplified e-commerce platform where users can view products, place orders, and check product availability in inventory.

The entire system is broken down into independent, scalable services that talk to each other securely and reliably — just like real-world cloud-native systems used by companies like Amazon or Netflix.

## 💡 What This Project Is About

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how different microservices can work together in a distributed architecture. Each microservice focuses on a single responsibility and communicates with others through well-defined APIs. The services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated using Docker Compose.

If you're learning **Spring Boot**, **microservices**, or **cloud-native development**, this project is a great real-world example to explore.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Here's how the services interact:

![Architecture 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9231911-65fb-4ebd-adb4-bf4ebc8491fe)  
![Architecture 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b19bcc20-eb5d-4f31-9f2f-f492cb126033)

> Discovery Server (Eureka) helps them find each other.  
> Each service has its own PostgreSQL database.  
> Monitoring is handled by Grafana.

## 📊 Observability

Grafana is pre-configured with dashboards to monitor service metrics. The config is located in `Grafana_Dashboard.json`.

**Grafana Access:**

- URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

---

## 🧪 Testing

Each service includes basic unit and integration tests.

```bash
./mvnw test
```
